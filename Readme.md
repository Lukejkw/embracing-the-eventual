# Embracing the Eventual

This repository contains the code example from my talk "Embracing the Eventual". It demonstrates an event driven application in action using MassTransit with a simple React frontend app.

> Disclaimer: This is not a production quality application! It's for demo purposes only and therefore bypasses things like CORS.

## Get Started

Start the backend up with `docker-compose up`

> Pass the `-d` or `--build` flags to start up in the background and/or rebuild images respectively
